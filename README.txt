1) I wrote the code in python environment and tried fixing problem with tsfresh feature-extraction by writing it
in a separate function, BUT it did not work out as I thought it would so I proceeded with writing code in python
notebook ..
2) All the .csv type data is the processed data, and all the .txt type data is the one downloaded from NASAs webpage
3) In the end, I tried building models with different regressors and in general each resulted in somewhat good predictions
on training data, and a rather poor ones on test data ...
4) Other 3 data sets provided by NASA were really bad, and I can not emphasize it enough :|. In addition I am sending you
plots of correlation matrices produced by other data sets. In general I think the first data set was the best one, and it did 
not make much sense for me to torment myself with the rest ..
